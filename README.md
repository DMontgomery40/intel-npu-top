**Status:** Pre-alpha prototype — expect incomplete features, rough edges, and limited functionality.

## ⚠️ Important Warning

This is an experimental prototype and is **NOT PRODUCTION READY**. Use at your own risk and expect:
- Incomplete features
- Potential bugs
- Limited error handling
- Possible system-specific issues

## Requirements

- Linux system with Intel Meteor Lake NPU
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Access to NPU sysfs entries (usually requires root privileges)
  - * check with `ls -lh /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0b.0/accel/accel0`

## Features

* Real-time NPU usage monitoring with ASCII bar chart visualization
* Historical view of the last 40 samples
* Automatic screen refresh
* Docker container support

## Installation

### Standalone Script

Just copy the STANDALONE.py script to your system and run it with Python 3.

### From PyPI   (Coming Soon)

### From Source

git clone https://github.com/DMontgomery40/intel-npu-top
cd intel-npu-top
python3 -m pip install .

### Using Docker

docker-compose up (best to not run `-d` if you want to see output; unless you're porting the output to another machine (e.g., out of a VM) this method is not ideal. 

## Usage

sudo intel-npu-top

Note: Root privileges are (usually) required to access the NPU sysfs entries*

  * check with `ls -lh /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0b.0/accel/accel0`
